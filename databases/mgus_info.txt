Natural history of 241 subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).
mgus: A data frame with 241 observations on the following 12 variables.

Details:
Plasma cells are responsible for manufacturing immunoglobulins, an important part of the immune defense. 
At any given time there are estimated to be about 10^6 different immunoglobulins in the circulation at any one time.
When a patient has a plasma cell malignancy the distribution will become dominated by a single isotype, 
the product of the malignant clone, visible as a spike on a serum protein electrophoresis. 
Monoclonal gammopathy of undertermined significance (MGUS) is the presence of such a spike, but in a patient with no evidence of overt malignancy. 
This data set of 241 sequential subjects at Mayo Clinic was the groundbreaking study defining the natural history of 
such subjects. Due to the diligence of the principle investigator 0 subjects have been lost to follow-up.

Three subjects had MGUS detected on the day of death.
In data set mgus1 these subjects have the time to MGUS coded as .5 day before 
the death in order to avoid tied times.

These data sets were updated in Jan 2015 to correct some small errors.
