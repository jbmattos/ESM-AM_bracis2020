In 1984, the German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG) started a multicenter randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness
of three versus six cycles of 500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 40 mg/m' methotrexate, and 600 mg/m2 flourouracil (CMF)
on day 1 and 8 starting perioperatively with or without tamoxifen (TAM) (3 x 10 mg/d for 2 years).
The aim of the trial was to compare recurrence-free and overall survival between the different treatment modalities.
This data frame contains the observations of 686 women.
