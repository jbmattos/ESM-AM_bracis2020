The data dowloaded consists of two tables: (1) data_clinical_patient, and (2) data_clinical_sample.
The file "ptc-database-unified.xlsx" imports both tables and merges them into a single one. 
It also provides a table compiling the 66 variables on the PTC resultant database and their descriptions.
The dataset from the .cvs file was extracted from the .xlsx PTC resultant database.
