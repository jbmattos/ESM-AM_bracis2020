data taken from: http://www.stat.rice.edu/~sneeley/STAT553/Datasets/survivaldata.txt
				 (description taken from link above)



Data set found in appendix D of Fleming and Harrington, Counting Processes and Survival Analysis, Wiley, 1991.
The only differences are: 
- age is in days 
- status is coded as 0=censored, 1=censored due to liver tx, 2=death 
- the sex and stage variables are not missing for obs 313-418
