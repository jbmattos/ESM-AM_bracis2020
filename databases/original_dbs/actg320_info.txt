"The data come from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that compared the 
three-drug regimen of Indinavir, open label Zidovudine or Stavudine and Lamivudine (group with IDV) 
with the two-drug regimen of Zidovudine or Stavudine and Lamivudine (group without IDV) 
in HIV-infected patients (Hammer et al., 1997). 
Patients were eligible for the trial if they had no more than 200 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter 
and at least three months of prior zidovudine therapy."
